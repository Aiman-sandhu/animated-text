# Animated Quotes Project

A simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project that animates multiple text quotes by rotating their characters in a loop. The project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation, string operations, and simple animation using `setInterval`.

## Features
- Animates text characters to create a smooth rotating effect.
- Supports multiple quotes (`<pre>` elements).
- Responsive and full-width layout.
- Clean, minimal design with a hacker-style theme.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Structure
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Animation logic

## How It Works
1. Each quote is wrapped in a `<pre>` tag with a unique ID.
2. The `animateString()` function rotates the text characters at a fixed interval.
3. The animation starts automatically on page load.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Watch the quotes animate!
